while producing snapshots with labels, the program
ppmlabel needs to read the file rgb.txt from
default places:

ppmlabel: can't open color names dictionary file named /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt,
/usr/openwin/lib/rgb.txt, or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt and En
vironment variable RGBDEF not set.
Set RGBDEF to the pathname of your rgb.txt file or don't use color names.
